// Interactive Authentication WebView Using Wry library https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry
// See the wry documentation for platform specific installation. Linux and macOS require
// installation of platform specific dependencies. These are not included by default.

// This example executes the Authorization Code OAuth flow and handles
// sign in/redirect using WebView as well as authorization and token retrieval.

// The WebView window will load on the sign in page for Microsoft Graph
// Log in with a user and upon redirect the window will close automatically.
// The credential_builder will store the authorization code returned on the
// redirect url after logging in and then build a ConfidentialClient<AuthorizationCodeCredential>

// The ConfidentialClient<AuthorizationCodeCredential> handles authorization to get an access token
// on the first request made using the Graph client. The token is stored in an in memory cache
// and subsequent calls will use this token. If a refresh token is included, which you can get
// by requesting the offline_access scope, then the confidential client will take care of refreshing
// the token.
