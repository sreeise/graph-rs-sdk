// The BodyRead object is used to provide easy use of many different types.

/*
In request methods that require a body you can use the following values:

- Any thing that implements serde serialize
- Anything implementing Read or AsyncRead using BodyRead::from_reader and
   BodyRead::from_async_read
- reqwest::Body (Async requests only)
- reqwest::blocking::Body (Blocking requests only)
- FileConfig which is a helper object for downloading files but can also be used
  for uploading files.


BodyRead can also take serializable objects, reqwest::Body, and reqwest::blocking::Body but
you do not need to use BodyRead for those. You can pass these objects directly to the
body parameter for those api methods that need one.
